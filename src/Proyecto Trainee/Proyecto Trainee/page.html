                    <hr>

                    <p>If you had thought about the possibility of carrying around a virtually unlimited supply of music
                        ten years ago, it would have seemed a bit futuristic, but it has all happened, and now all we
                        have to do when we get tired of our present music collection is download free song for Ipod.
                        This could however, be the start of a few problems…
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Your computer picks up a virus. You did an internet search, looking to download free song for
                        Ipod, and, totally without knowing, you downloaded some nasty spyware or malware from a dodgy
                        p2p site. Your laptop has now stopped working, version of songs etc, but you have probably
                        noticed that you often download a file, and it is completely different from what it is supposed
                        to be. In case you have ever
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is illegal. It is against the law to download from a P2P site. It could lead to your arrest.
                        It is not difficult with modern equipment for law enforcement officers to locate your IP
                        address, and then locate you. World governments are becoming ever more proactive in combating
                        this – it will not be long before you are found out if you are using P2P . You will have to
                        think about whether it is worth risking prison or possibly a huge fine, just to download free
                        song for Ipod. I’m sure it won’t be worth it for many.</p>
